  about:
    "A highly motivated 3rd-year undergraduate student specializing in Backend & Frontend Development. Throughout my studies, I have actively served in various campus organizations, where I have led and contributed directly to the development of real-world applications. I possess a solid understanding of MVC and design patterns using the Laravel Framework, coupled with strong OOP capabilities in Java and Kotlin. While my primary focus is backend, I also hold secondary skills in frontend development (React JS/Next JS), allowing me to grasp the bigger picture of the software development lifecycle.",
